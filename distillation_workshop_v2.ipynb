Introduction: What is Knowledge Distillation?\n","\n","**Knowledge Distillation** is a technique whereby a student neural network learns from another, usually already pre-trained neural network. KD can be used for compressing the model, in which case the student is smaller. It can also be used for improving model performance, where the student is the same or even larger than the teacher. In either case, the the student is trained to mimic the behavior of one or more teacher models.\n","\n","### Why do we need it?\n","\n","- **Deployment constraints**: Large models are expensive to run on edge devices, mobile phones, or in real-time applications\n","- **Inference speed**: Smaller models are faster\n","- **Cost reduction**: Less compute = less money and energy\n","- **Increased performance**: Sometimes KD is used to increase the performance of our model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mmk4A2LunBrH"},"source":["## Why Does KD work?\n","\n","### The \"Dark Knowledge\"\n","\n","In their seminal 2015 paper, [Hinton et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531). observed that the **soft probability outputs** of a teacher model contain more information than hard labels.\n","\n","**Example**: For a cat image, hard label says `[0, 0, 1, 0, ...]` (just \"cat\")  \n","But soft labels might say `[0.01, 0.05, 0.85, 0.09, ...]` revealing that the image also looks a bit like a dog or tiger!\n","\n","This extra information about class relationships is the \"dark knowledge\" that helps the student learn better.\n","\n","![Distillation Diagram](https://intellabs.github.io/distiller/imgs/knowledge_distillation.png)\n","\n","\n","### Reweighing Training Examples\n","\n","Even if we ignore probabilities for all classes other than the true class, we get an effect where some examples are weighted higher than other ones according to what probability the teacher assigns to the true class. [Tang et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03532) showed that this *importance weighing* is an important component of how KD works."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n6FpaMfYU2Ki"},"source":["## 2.
